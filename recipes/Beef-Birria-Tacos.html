    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's
      slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy
      tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the
        peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.
      </li>
      <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
      <li>
        Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes,
        vinegar, and seasonings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook
        until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to
        rest, then shred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions,
        and cilantro.
